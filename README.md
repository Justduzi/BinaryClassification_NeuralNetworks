# BinaryClassification_NeuralNetworks

This repository implements binary classification of neural networks using Keras Sequential models. The models are built on Jupyter Notebook using Python, and random data is generated to train and test the models. Decision boundaries are also plotted to visualize the performance of the models.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook


Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
2. jupyter notebook
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open binary-classification-keras.ipynb.

Run the code cells in the notebook to generate the random data, train and test the models, and plot the decision boundaries.

# Description
The repository contains the following files:

1. binary-classification-keras.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for generating random data, building the models, training and testing the models, and plotting the decision boundaries.

2. README.md: The file you are currently reading.
